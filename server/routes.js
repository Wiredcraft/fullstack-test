    description: `Whose woods these are I think I know.   
      His house is in the village though;   
      He will not see me stopping here   
      To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

      My little horse must think it queer   
      To stop without a farmhouse near   
      Between the woods and frozen lake   
      The darkest evening of the year.   

      He gives his harness bells a shake   
      To ask if there is some mistake.   
      The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   
      Of easy wind and downy flake.   

      The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
      But I have promises to keep,   
      And miles to go before I sleep,   
      And miles to go before I sleep.`,
